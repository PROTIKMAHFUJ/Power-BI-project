# Power-BI-project

I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze sales performance across multiple regions and product categories. The project included data cleaning, transforming raw data into actionable insights, and building complex relationships using primary and foreign keys. I used DAX to create custom measures for KPIs like total sales, growth metrics, and year-over-year analysis.
Key features:
•	Cleaned and prepared datasets for analysis
•	Created efficient data models with defined relationships
•	Built interactive dashboards with slicers and drill-downs
•	Delivered actionable business insights to help track regional performance, top products, and seasonal trends.
Technologies: Power BI, DAX, Power Query Editor
